Afterthoughts
Created by Mike Abrahamson, St. Edward's University

Compatible with Omeka 2.0
Latest version tested: Omeka 2.0.1

The Afterthoughts Plugin works by creating a new field in the ElementTexts
table for each item based on the original filenames you give it.
It was originally designed to be used directly after using the Dropbox plugin.

Basic Operation:

Type or Copy and Paste a list of original filenames into the textbox.
Select your Metadata field you would like to add.
Enter your metadata.
Check if it should be interpreted as HTML.  Current version does not give the
HTML editor when checked, but does pass the value to the table.
Click the Apply Metadata button.

How It Works:

The plugin will now take each filename and attempt to find it in the database.
Once found, it will verify that there is only one item for that filename.
If there are multiple items, it will not upload any data and will add that
filename to the log to report later.
If it cannot find the filename, it will not upload any data and will add that
filename to the log to report later.
If it successfully finds the filename, it will find the item_id and then
add the item to the ElementTexts table with that item_id.  It also logs the
filename in the success message to report later.
Once all files have been looked at, it will return to the Afterthoughts page
and display all successes and errors.

Known Issues:

Currently, the record_type is set to "Item" for all entries.
The metadata selector can be fairly cumbersome if you have a lot of fields.
